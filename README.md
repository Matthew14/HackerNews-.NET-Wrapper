HackerNews-.NET-Wrapper
=======================

A very basic wrapping of the hacker news [api](https://github.com/HackerNews/API "api docs on github") in C# using the [RestSharp](http://restsharp.org/ "RestSharp Homepage") library.

There's no error checking or anything yet, so be warned.

The console project shows basic usage examples.
